## Overview
I took on a novice HTML/CSS challenge from Frontend Mentor that required the development of a 3-column preview card component. 
This was my first HTML/CSS project as a beginner HTML/CSS programmer.
Overall, it took me 10-12 hours to complete this challenge and it was fun to create this from scratch. 

### The challenge
The challenge was developing a 3-column preview card that displayed 3 different columns describing 3 car types with information on each one and three buttons that say, "Learn More". 
Images, color formats, and font were provided for the challenge. 
The rules of the challenge were that users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development
There is room for a lot more improvement for me in such areas as media attributes, padding, margin, and positions. These are areas I will focus more on in future projects.
